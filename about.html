          <p>
            I was born in Poland, where I first started my design work. From 2016, I am located in Denmark. Currently I am a student of Multimedia Design course of Copenhagen School of Design and Technology. My learning is focused on video
            production, UX/UI, graphic design and front-end web development. In Portfolio section you will find examples of my work so far, together with my analysis of the assignments' objectives. Outside of my studies, I am a seasoned event manager
            with a background in the experience economy and immersive design. I am also a public speaker and a facilitator, talking about inclusion, the importance of young leaders and volunteer culture. I strive to create safe and empowering spaces
            within the events I participate in. I believe that empathy and inclusion create not only strong communities but also unforgettable and transformative experiences.
